# Web-Parser
This is a HTML parser built using Ruby.
## Purpose
As an avid Internet shopper, I've always wondered if there's anyway I could create somekind of software that could collect the prices and names of items for me in an efficient way. I believe that once I could figured how to do that, I could use that information to effectively collect a database of information to predict and catch the best deals on the Internet.
So, for fun, I decided to create a web-parser that could collect the name, the brand, and the price of every item on the famous luxury fashion store, ssense.com. The data is collect into an Array that could easily be implemented into an excel format that would allow me to view a lot more items in a quicker fashion. I've yet to decide what to do with the information collected, but I've several ideas to come.
